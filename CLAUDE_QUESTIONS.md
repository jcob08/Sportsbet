# Claude Guidance & Questions

## Project Summary
This project is an MLB betting pipeline with contextual feature engineering, real-time odds integration, and betting simulation. The workflow includes:
- Loading and cleaning real MLB game data
- Engineering contextual features (ballpark, weather, umpire, player stats)
- Fetching and merging real betting odds
- Calculating implied probabilities and model edge
- Simulating betting strategies

## What I Want Claude To Help With

1. **Data Merging Robustness**
   - How can I make the merging of odds and game data more robust, especially with team name mismatches or missing games?

2. **Handling Missing Odds**
   - What’s the best way to handle games that don’t have odds available (historical or future games)?

3. **Feature Engineering Best Practices**
   - Are there any improvements or best practices for my contextual feature engineering pipeline?

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - How can I best evaluate the performance of my betting model, given the available data?

5. **General Code Review**
   - Are there any code quality, structure, or efficiency improvements you recommend?

## Sample Data & Output
- See `sample_merged_game_data.csv` and `sample_odds_data.csv` for data format.
- See `README.md` for workflow and usage.
